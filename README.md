In this repository we can find the R scripts used in our study (Ostria-Gallardo et al) about the ability of the Proteaceae tree _Gevuina avellana_ to live in diverse light conditions. Especifically, these R scripts shows how to make a Principal Component analysis coupled with a self-organized map (PCA-SOM), and how to perform and visualize a gene co-expression network analysis on a RNAseq dataset.
